- I want you to create an SDL project which draws a lunar scene. 

Done - The viewpoint should be directly toward the origin and set up 10 units from the origin in the positive z-axis and 2 units up in the y-direction. 

- On the left hand, right hand, and back of the scene, I want you to generate mountains using Perlin noise and use Bezier patches to draw this terrain smoothly. 

Done - In the center of the scene you should see a smooth planar ground with with a crater texture on it. 

Done - Resting at the origin of the scene, should be a lunar lander. 

Done - Hitting the space bar should start a 5 second animation where the lander takes off, goes up a little, and lands back down. 

- The texture for the ground should be applied with an oversampling. 

- Submit this project in Hw3.zip. You should with your project a readme.txt listing the group members, their ids, and where to find stuff in your code that illustrates each of the above coding things can be found in your project sources.
